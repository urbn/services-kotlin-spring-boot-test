# Introduction
Cevher here. Thank you for your time in advance. I have been in software development from 1994-1995 with many years of C/C++ all under Linux. I covered a lot of various aspects of software engineering before moving to Java, Performance Engineering, Embedded Linux Development, and finally DevOps for Platform Automation Engineering in AWS. I have not been coding in Java for a while. Last was around 2 years back in Java. I used Gatling earlier. I come from Java land and recently moved to taking devops roles and eventually becoming a platform engineer. I recently obtained AWS Solution Architect Certificate - Associate and Cloud Practioner. I am preparing for AWS SysOps Exam for tomorrow. 

# Summary 
It was a pleasure to have gone through the coding challenge here. It gave me opportunity to brush up my Java skills as well as refreshing Scala and totally new to Kotlin, in fact first time in getting that set up and going. I liked the whole project the way it was set up around Kotlin and the way TDD is structured neatly. 

# Self Assesment and Status 
Endpoint 1 and Endpoint 2 are implemented and validated. Faced issues with Endpoint 3. Added a directory for review only purpose here: quicktest.info I think the most important stage for me was to get the environment and getting the state 1. I struggled with the calculations and getting the correct values set up through formulas for each test cases, They all worked eventually. I could be happier if I worked with Kotlin and would better decorate functions, variables, systax and style. I mostly spent time to get constructing the expected funtionality and happy when they worked!!

# Thank you!
Thanks in advance. I have a lot to offer and demonstrated my willingness and technical flexibility by taking completely new environment and language here through this exam. I hope to have passed here so I could have chance to provide more details elsewhere. I look forward to speaking with you.
